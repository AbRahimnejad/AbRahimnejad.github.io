## Short Biography
I am a research fellow at McMaster University's Intelligent and Cognitive Engineering Laboratory. My work focuses on estimation, machine learning, and optimization for cyber‑physical systems, with applications in resilient, data‑driven operation and control of smart energy systems as well as mechatronic and robotic platforms. I develop robust state‑estimation and filtering methods and explore learning‑based approaches that improve sensing, inference, and decision‑making in complex, noisy environments.

### Research Profile

Estimation and identification; machine learning; optimization methods; cyber-physical systems; data-driven and ML-aided resilient operation and control of smart systems.  
Experience spanning smart energy systems and mechatronic/robotic platforms.
